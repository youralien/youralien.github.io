        <b>Bio. </b>I am pursuing my PhD at Northwestern University, where I am working with <a class="inherit-link" href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/">Haoqi Zhang</a> on the design of human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence systems. My work bridges the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. My graduate study is in <a class="inherit-link" href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu">Technology and Social Behavior</a>, a joint program between Computer Science and Communication Studies. My training will equip me with the techniques to design and implement AI systems and the methods to evaluate them for human-centered measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some specific systems I am design and studying now can be found on my active projects page
      <p>
        In addition to my research, I am a project head for the <a class="inherit-link" href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> course program at Northwestern, where I mentor more than 20 undergraduate students on self-directed research projects, many of which get published at top HCI conferences.
