        I have started my postdoc at Stanford CS in Sept 2023, working in the broad area of AI-Assisted Mental Health Conversations.

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
       ✨ In late August 2023, I defended my PhD thesis! ✨ The thesis was titled "Human-AI Interface Layers: Enhancing Communication of Intent for AI-Assisted Creative Pursuits and Social Experiences"

      <!--   ✨ I am on the job market! ✨ I am seeking opportunities as a Computer Science Faculty or Research Scientist. I am excited to pursue a research agenda that advances humans’ own capacities for interfacing with AI, so that AI-enabled applications can effectively facilitate a variety of human goals, from social connection, creative expression, and beyond. -->

        I was also awarded a Google PhD Fellowship in Human Computer Interaction in 2022! Northwestern wrote a nice <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/news-events/news/articles/2022/supporting-designers-in-expressing-human-experiences-to-ai-and-context-aware-technologies.html">article featuring me as a fellowship recipient</a>.

      <h5 id="about">About me</h5>

      <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in Northwestern's <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior</a> program, working with Prof. <a class="hero-text link" href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/">Haoqi Zhang</a> at the Delta Lab. My research supports people’s ability to interface with existing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. I build human-AI interfaces to effectively ensure AI-enabled applications support people's desires for socially connecting and personally empowering experiences.

        In my dissertation, I designed a platform for creating <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434178?cid=99659476551">Opportunistic Collective Experiences (OCEs)</a>, a new AI-enabled social technology that identifies and facilitates opportunities for friends and family to engage in shared experiences. To create OCEs, I built tools for interfacing with existing AI detection and coordination abilities, so designers can structure opportunities, <a
        href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491102.3501902?cid=99659476551"
        >express high-level situations</a>, and encode human expectations for execution during deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work at Google Research, I developed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376739?cid=99659476551">steering interfaces</a> so creators could feel greater control and effectively evoke emotions in music when partnering with generative AI. Check out the blog post I wrote that summarizes this <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/people-first-hci-ml-collaborations">People First Approach</a> to developing Generative AI applications for music creation.
