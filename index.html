        <b>Bio. </b>In my graduate work, I aim to design, implement, and evaluate Cerebro, a computational platform for detecting and facilitating <i>opportunistic interactions</i>, or serendipitous moments in usersâ€™ daily lives for engaging in shared activities, to support social connection at distance. This purposed research is advancing my interests in designing intelligent human-machine systems, and my desire to empower people to build stronger social connections, increase social capital, and increase their emotional well-being. Advancing these goals requires taking an interdisciplinary approach; in this vein, my work draws on methods from HCI, AI, and social science to devise novel technological solutions to complex human problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am pursuing an interdisciplinary PhD in Computer Science and Communications through the Technology and Social Behavior Program at Northwestern University. I have had the pleasure of pursuing this research with Dr. <a class="inherit-link" href="http://dgergle.soc.northwestern.edu/">Darren Gergle</a> and my advisor, Dr. <a class="inherit-link" href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/">Haoqi Zhang</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my research, I am a SIG (Special Interest Group) head for the <a class="inherit-link" href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> studio at Northwestern, where I've had the opportunity to co-mentor several wonderful undergraduate students while they practice to self-direct their own independent, Systems HCI research projects (Shoutout to Sanfeng Wang, Ryan Jeon, Matthew Wang, Andrew Finke, Jennie Werner, Allison Sun, Suzy Lee, Meg Grasse, Eunice Lee).
