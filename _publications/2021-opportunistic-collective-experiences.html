Despite many available social technologies for connecting at a distance,
we don't always find opportunities to actively engage in shared
experiences and activities with friends and loved ones, even though this
kind of interaction is associated with increased social closeness.
To better support active engagement in shared experiences and activities
while also making it convenient to find opportunities for interacting in
this way, our work explores the design of Opportunistic Collective
Experiences (OCEs), or social experiences powered by computer programs
that identify opportune moments when users share situations across
distance and structure shared activities in those situations. To support
interacting with, programming, and executing OCEs, we developed Cerebro,
a computational platform that consists of a mobile app that supports
users' social interaction, an API for expressing the situations and
activities that make up the interactional opportunity, and an
opportunistic execution engine that checks for interactional
opportunities and executes them when possible. Through a 20 day
deployment study tested with groups of geographically-distributed
college alumni (N=21), we found that OCEs promoted opportunities for
active engagement; facilitated interactions that were socially
connecting by structuring ways to engage in shared experiences and
activities; and made actively engaging easier by identifying situations
appropriate for interacting and structuring how to engage in activities
in these situations. We contribute to CSCW (1) a novel interaction that
facilitates engaging in shared experiences and activities at distance
during coincidental moments; and (2) the design of systems to interact
with, program, and execute these kinds of interactions.
