<h2 class="section-heading">Your Final Assignment, if you choose to embark on it...</h2>

<b>Develop a 3 agent robot soccer team that will play against your fellow classmates!</b>.  This assignment was the final project for EE4306: Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems, offered at the National University of Singapore when I studied abroad there in Spring 2016.

The path planning, team strategy, and controls to the <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/">robotic simulator</a> was written in Python.  The 3 agents were two-wheeled robots, a faster version of something like a Roomba.

If there was one thing I brought to our 3 student team, it was my ability to organize our software code base during the 6 weeks.  I introduced Git practices and developed the parent classes that helped all our algorithms integrate into a single robot soccer team.

The climax was definitely cheering for our own robots, as they <b>scored the only ball in goal</b> during our in-class competition.
