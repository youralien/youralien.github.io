There is a course developed by Edith Law from the Univeristy of Waterloo called ["Human-AI Interaction", which is the most up-to-date version of this CS889 course offered in Spring 2018](http://edithlaw.ca/cs889/2018/calendar.html).

# Synopsis of Papers

Greg D'Eon, a grad student at Waterloo who took the course in person, wrote down some [rough personal notes on a subset of the papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBmaMfA_CQS1ZdUbdzeLMTWbzcDbDS-_WTuD5eRU4Xw/edit).

## Issue in the Field: Making it easier for smart humans to interface and build machine learning models

*Title*: FeatureInsight

*CoP*: Supporting feature ideation when ML model creators are using their own domain-knowledge to create models.

*Relevance*: Good framing on the CoP Affinder focuses on, which was developed for practical goals in the context aware computing domain, but for similar outcomes like stretching creators to think of more relevant features or representations.
