<h2 class="section-heading">Gunna Fold Em' All!</h2>

<a href="http://poe.olin.edu/">Principles of Engineering</a> is our mechatronic class every Olin student takes, typically in their sophomore year. Here's the breakdown...

- 8 weeks
- 4 design reviews, meaning 2 week sprint cycles
- $250 budget
- 5 teammates
- A glorious and painful way to learn system integration

What did we decide to engineer? <b>A machine that could fold and launch its own paper airplanes</b>.  Some serious <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/3l3e1m/3d_printed_machine_shooting_out_paper_airplanes/">reddit post of a person making their own paper airplane machine</a> inspired us to try this feat ourselves.

We have the whole project documented on our <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/gfa/">website</a>, where we cover things like our process of <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/gfa/#back-folder">testing different components in isolation</a>, reflections on our <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/gfa/#integration">integration pains</a>, and even our <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/poe2014/gfa/#materials">bill of materials</a>.

My only regret at the end of that fall semester was that we only made a paper airplane <b>dispenser</b>, and never had time to integrate a <b>launcher</b> module into the final CAD model.  During that following winter break, I set out to rectify that regret.

I was pretty satisfied with the final product, for which the design was a direct inspiration from a <a href="https://youtu.be/wC60S7d_Nr4">YouTube video posted by a Dad who built the same launcher for his daughters at home to use</a>.  Our team ended up being invited to a community wide science fair to showcase our project, where we brought both the dispenser we made for the course and the launcher I had made during my free winter break -- for all the children to enjoy :)
